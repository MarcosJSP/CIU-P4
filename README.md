# Camera Projections - by MarcosJSP

The objective of this project is to get familiarized  with projections. 

The project shows planets rotating over a star, through different camera views. Here is a demo of how it looks:

## Development

The camera positioning and targeting, is possible thanks to the [camera()](https://processing.org/reference/camera_.html) function. Also, here is the short-cuts menu that shows all the possibilities that the project offers:
